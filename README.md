# D&D Character Class App

Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) has become increasingly popular over the years but it can be a difficult game to get get into as a newcomer. This app hopes to help new players ease into the game by helping them with the first step of creating a character: picking a class.

You can take a quiz which will recommend a class based on your answers. If you prefer to get an idea of which classes are available, you can go to the overview page. Here you use a search bar to look for a specific class or filter on spellcasting ability if you prefer. Lastly you can save your favourites to your profile page.
